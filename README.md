This game is a combination of Fantasy Football and Texas Hold'Em Poker

Note: In order to `import` the necessary modules from firebase, I had to set 
the script type to module. A server is needed to use modules (https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/the-type-module-in-html-file-whats-for/488865/10), so I used http-server
and it worked.

To install http-server:

`npm install -g http-server`

To start the server:

`http-server`
